# SystemDotProperty
A little java GUI app to check certain system properties! 

## What is this useful for?
This is useful for checking certain system properties while developing, to know how it is formatted and what it contains.
By system properties I mean the properties that you can get from the `System` class in java, like `System.getProperty("os.name")` or `System.getProperty("user.home")`.
